I am intrested in Python for long time, but this is the first time I try to write a code. Although the code I typed in vs code is very simple, it is a milestone for myself.
When I searched online, I googled "interesting python programs with code", then it popped in a page about some easy programming codes.
I tried a program to print a calendar of the specified month and year.
Python has a built-in module, the calendar, which helps to access a record of the calendar. There are many methods in this module, in this program, we are trying to print the calendar of the specified month of a given year.
I copied the code and typed in my VS code and run it without debugging.
I tested in Terminal and it worked.
Python is so interesting!
However, my reflection about this programming code is each space blank and different types of crackets are all important. It is a challenge for me to learn different functions in Python.
I think the only way to impove Python skills is to practice everyday.
